# PCA9635

Yet another Arduino library for controlling the [NXP PCA9635 I2C-controlled 16-LED driver](http://www.nxp.com/products/power-management/lighting-driver-and-controller-ics/isup2-supc-led-display-control/16-bit-fm-plus-i2c-bus-led-driver:PCA9635PW).

I wrote this library back circa 2012 for a project that used quite a number of LEDs and nixie tubes.  There are other PCA9635 libraries out there, and mine might not be the best, but it has worked well for me.
